Generation of the KRAS dependency volcano plot and the CERES score comparison from "Targeting p130Cas- and Microtubule-dependent MYC Regulation Sensitizes Pancreatic Cancer to ERK MAPK Inhibition"

Data analysis for plot generation is performed in the jupyter notebook titled "KRAS Mut v WT - BCAR1 Analysis.ipynb", which also has a corresponding HTML output in file "/Users/kevinkapner/Documents/Individuals/Andy/20200312-KRASMutWT-BCAR1-Channing/Watersetal/code/KRAS Mut v WT - BCAR1 Analysis.html".

The R notebook "Figures.Rmd" was used to read in the data and create the final figures. There is also a corresponding HTML version titled "Figures.html".

All raw data used for analysis can be found at the following DropBox link: 

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/204cf7vv1l4ea8c/AACmAupkrVLAJRHhcgkrR_14a?dl=0

Once downloaded, the data directory should be placed in the same level as the code and output directories.
